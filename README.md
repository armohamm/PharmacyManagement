# PharmacyManagement
A management system for a local pharmacy, which has two branches to improve their functionality in employee, inventory and sales management.
We have also bought up a common database for both branches for two main reasons, 
  1. so they can share details (ex: stock sizes to direct customers to the other branche if one doesnot have a medicine)
  2. to give the owner the access to handle and observe the transactions of both branches from a single place
  
This one is coded to run on localhost,for the demonstration. But for actual implementation client bought a server.
